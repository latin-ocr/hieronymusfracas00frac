source of diseases, it is because the changeable nature
of its elements exposes it to corrupti0n; it is because it is
equally prompt to impregnate itself with the morbific
miasms and to disseminate those with which it is
charged.

Again, consider on the other hand in what manner
air may be modified in the course of ages3 learn how it
conceived the germ of the fatal contagion which it has
spread among us.

The sun and the stars are the sovereign masters to
whom the air and the earth and the waters do servile
obedienee. Their course and their evolutions in the
heavens rule the course of the elements. Thus, directly
Phebus approaches the earth by directing his rapid
coursers to the South‚ cold winter shows itself with rigon
the soil hardens and is covered with trost and ice stops
the course of rivers. On the other hand, hardly has the
God of Day entered in the sign of Cancer, but the burn-
ing Summer devours the fields and the woods, dries up
the prairies and covers the tilled parts with an arid dust.
And it is not doubtful, either, that the elements in their
state ol repose in the same manner as during the great
revolutions which agitate them, are subject to multiple
sidereal influences which they obey, either from the moon,
the queen of night, which holds under its laws the seas
and all the moist principles of nature, or from the sinister
star Saturn, or from the beneficent fires of Jupiter, the
rays of Mars and of Venus. Those manifestations be·-
come especially marked when the stars deviate from their
courses and when several ol them converge upon one
