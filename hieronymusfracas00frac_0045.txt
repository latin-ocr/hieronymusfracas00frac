SYPHlLlDIS LIBER TERTIUS

O muse, beyond the columns ol Hercules a new world
claims thee. Listen to those murmuring waves which
call thee to distant shores. Co, take thy impulse and
celebrate in verses the foreign tree which assuages our
pains and places a limit to our affliction. And thou,
celestial Urania, put on thy medical purple, show to the
peoples ol Italy thy brow crowned with the August
branches of Guaiac‚ and relate the wonderful prodigies
of which our century is a witness.

Ah! heroic century, may some day an illustrious
poet consecrate the accents of his lyre to thee! Let him
then narrate this inspired singer of heroes and of glory,
how our intrepid fleets set out to conquer another conti-
nent beyond the unknown seas! Let him sing of those
new worlds recently discovered, their cities, their rivers,
their different peoples, their strange customs‚ their skies
bespangled with glittering pleiades! Let him relate those
combats, those memorable battles which subjected to our
laws a continent until then ignored! Let him especially
note for the admiration of future centuries that frail bark
which alone, plows with its bold prow the immensity ol
the seas! Happy the favorite of Apollo who will be
able to worthily limn such marvels! My Muse would not
dare to aspire to such a brilliant task; more modest, she
will do naught but here celebrate a sacred tree; she will
recite its virtues, she will recount how it was discovered
and how it was imported among us from a distant shore.
