point of the sky. Such disturbances‚ it is true, as signs
of divine will, do not produce themselves except at rare
intervals and after a long series of regular cycles. But,
when they do accomplish their end, when the hour fixed
for them by destiny has sounded, then, oh misfortune;
the earth, the air, and the waters are suddenly turned
over to fearsome cataclysms. At times it is thick clouds
which steal the light of day; the sky melts into waren
torrents hurl themselves from the crests of mountains,
carrying away, in their impetuous force, trees. rocks, and
flocks of animals; raising above their banks their roaring
waves, the Erida and the Ganges inundate cities. sub-
merge forem, and form new streams. At other times,
it is the unchained winds which blow with fury, or sub-
terranean storms which shake the ground and throw over
the walls ol cities. Perhaps even, alas! there will come
a day, an unlucky day marked by Nature and the
Destinies, when those countries which we inhabit today
will either be changed into an uncultivated desert or be
swallowed up in the waves; or the sun himself, Oh pro-
digy! will follow a new course in space; or the seasons
will be turned topsy-turvy; or extraordinary heats or colds
will desolate the world; during which unknown animals
will rise to the light, borrowing their principle of life from
the eternal source ol all creation!

Who knows whether the earth at such a time, trying
itself at more arduous labors may not produce a‘new some
Encelatae, Ceae, Typhae, daring Titans, who will at-
tempt for a second time to pile Olympus on Ossa in
order to scale the heavens, their old home ‚³
