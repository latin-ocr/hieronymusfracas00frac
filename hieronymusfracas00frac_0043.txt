troubles. When that sacred stream shall have passed
over thy body three times, thou shalt be delivered of thy
disease and its impure poison.” At these words, she
plunges her virgin hands into the river; three times she
takes out ῃ of it the liquid metal and three times she
spreads it on the limbs of llceus. O prodigy! lt is done!
The disease at once disappears‚ and his hideous covering,
on contact with this glowing flood, dissolves and dis-
appears in a moment!

“Now leave,’' continued Lipara, “go find the day,
the pure sky and the fortunate regions that the sun lights.
But let thy first care be to offer a sacrifice to Diana, to
the gods of these gloomy places and to the goddess who
has saved thy days.'’

She has spoken and resumes the road to the cavern.
llceus follows her, intoxicated with gratitude and joy; he
soon passes the threshold ol the darksome empire and
sees again the radiant clearness of day.

Renown immediately seized this prodigy, and soon
the sublime virtues of mercury were known throughout
the universe.

At the beginning, mercury was employed associated
with lard; later it was combined with the turpentine of
Epirus and with the resin of the majestic birch. Certain
physicians today combine it with horse fat or bear's
grease, or bdellium and with the juice of cedar, others

with myrrh, with male incense, with mibium and with
burning sulphur. F or my part, l prefer to alloy it with
a mixture of black hellebore, orris root, galbanum, asa-
fetida, oil of mastic‚ and oil ol native sulphur.
