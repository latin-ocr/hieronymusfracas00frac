weight ol their golden fruit! Divine tree, which Venus
endowed with marvelous powers as a souvenir of her
dear Adonis, we hail thee who, in actual trouble, fur-
nishes us the most useful help for our disease.

Another remedy imagined by the industry of man.
Look at that glass ball with a tapering neck, with a
roundish paunch. There has just been poured in it some
water together with a few handluls ol ivy leaves and ol
dittany‚ or roots ol orris, of perprunum and of elder. ln
a short time, under the influence of the flame, the liquid
comes to a small boil; light vapors are freed and fill the
dome off the apparatus; but hardly have they touched
its walls cooled by the outer air than they condense in a
dew, running on the cap and flowing into the serpentine
tube. The liquid obtained by this ingenious distillation
possesses marvelous powers to dissolve the last ferments
of the disease. lt must be taken hot in glassful doses, in

copious sweats. During the course ol this treatment,

spread its ravages. This caustic associated with fats and
with dessicants, will be equally useful to employ for the
destruction of pustules, to dissolve callosities and cicatrize
