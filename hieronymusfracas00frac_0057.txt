heavens among them; they have nothing to look alter
among the things here below!' '⁹

“But Sirius, whom nothing escapes,¹ Sirius who with
one look embraces the universe, could not see without
indignationnsuch sacrileges. ln his anger, he charges his
rays with pestilential poisons and virulent miasms‚ which
simultaneously inlect the air, the earth and the waters.
At once upon this crimina! earth there arises an unknown
plague. Syphilus is the first attacked by it, on account
of having been the first to profane the sacred altars. Α
hideous leprosy covers his body; fearful pains torture his
limbs and banish sleep from his eyes. Then‚ this terri-
ble disease—known since then among us by the name
of Syphilis—does not take long to spread in our entire
nafion, not even sparing our King himself’.

“Our fathers then, in their alarm, ran to ask the
nymph America, who gives the sacred oracles in the
woods of Carthese. They ask her the cause of the dis-
ease which is afflicting them3 they implore of her a
remedy for their sufferings”.

“ ‘ lmpious mortals’, answers the nymph, ⁶ you
have had the presumption to equal yourselves to the
gods, and today you suffer the punishment of your crime.
Go, go without loss of time, to implore your pardon of
the god whom you have offended; re-erect those altars
and offer to him those sacrifices which are his due. Per-
haps you may, in this manner, appease his anger. But
do not hope to see the end ol the scourge that is afflicting

you. This disease shall be eternaL and whosoever
shall be born on this earth will suffer from its attacksf,
