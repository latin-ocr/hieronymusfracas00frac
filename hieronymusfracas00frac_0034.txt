that are turning green. But l stop, for l cannot mention
all. Other cares demand my attention also. O muse,
it is time to leave the shade of Aonia to approach the
domain of nature. Α new career opens before my steps.
May l gather there, in default of poetic laurels, the hum-

voted to the saving of so many victims! ll the disease
occurs in Spring or even in Autumn, if the patient is
young, robust, and plethoric, the indication is to open

body of corrupted blood. In addition, no matter what
the season, hasten to place purgatives at work: for, this
is the most certain means oi evacuating peccant humors
and morbid ferments. At all events it is proper not to
have recourse to them until alter due preparation of the
channels by resolvents‚ cutting medicines‚ and such as

tops of hops with the undulating stem, fennel, smallage,

capillaria which remains dry on the bosom of the waters‚
sterile ceterach, hart's tongue with reddish filiata. Make

squills with the acrid taste‚ of bitter colocynth, of helle-
bore, sea star whose flowers change color three times
daily, ginger‚ wild cucumber, olibanum, myrrh, bdellium,
