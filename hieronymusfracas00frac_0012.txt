cisions of destiny, and the mysterious origin of a frightlul
scourge.

And thou divine Urania, thou who knowest the
cause and effects of all things, thou for whom the spaces
of air and the depths of the heavens hold no secrets‚ de-
scend to my side under these quiet shades where the
breath of the zephyrs, the perfume of the myrtle ancl the
harmonious murmurs of Banacus invite me to sing. Cive
me the sacred inspiration, and may, in return, as through
Olympus thou traversest the luminous field of ether, the
sublime choir of the celestial world applaud thy glory.

Muse, what causes presided at the origin of this
scourge so long wrapped in the darkness of nothing?
Was it imported among us from those new worlds which
were discovered by the brave mariners of Spain beyond
the unknows seas ol the Western world? Have we re-
ceived from those far countries the germ where it is said
it has reigned as sovereign master from all eternity, num-
bering as many victims as there are inhabitants? ls it
true that introduced, in that manner, among us it was
then spread throughout Europe by means of commercial
relations? ls it true that it was born weak and obscure,
to increase its force a hundred {old later on as it extended
its ravages and invaded, little by little, the entire universe?
Such as once, springing from a badly extinguished focus
which an imprudent shepherd left in the country, a sin-
gle spark sufficed to start a conflagration; the fire first
slumbers and insidiously spreads in the grass, then bursts
out with fury; the flame, fed by the fuel, then raises itself
in threatening tongues, devours on its passage the fields
