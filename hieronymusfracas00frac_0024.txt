they fix themselves on the muscles, they attach them-
selves to the exsanguined framework of the tissues, and
give rise to horrible sufferings wherever they adhere.

The most subtle of these morbid humors, those which

denuding the bones, eating the lips and penetrating the
throat‚ from which there only issues a weak and plaintive
voice.

At other times, again, there exhales from the skin
