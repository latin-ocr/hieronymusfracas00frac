centuries the memorable history. My muse dares not
aspire to such subjects; she has put upon herself a more
humble task‚ whose course she will pursue.

Blood has not the same identical composition in all
patients. ll it is pure, it is a good presage; if, on the
contrary, it is thick, superabundant and charged with
bile, the disease, under such conditions will be more
serious, more rebellious, and will only give way to the
use ol more energetic measures, as well as more violent.

Thai which is the most essentia! to a cure, is to
surprise the disease at its inception‚ to strangle it in the
form of a germ before it has had time to invade the
viscera. For when it has penetrated into the organism‚
when it has taken root and developed its ravages, it is
alas! but at the price of rough experience that one
can succeed in expelling it. Apply yourself then, be-
fore all, to combat it at its very inception‚ and engrave
in your mind the precepts which will follow.

patients, the quality of the air that you breathe‚ is
far from being an indifferent matter. Learn how to
avoid winds from the south; flee from the fogs and from
wet grounds with pernicious effluvia. Choose for a stay
a laughing country with uncovered horizon or some hill-
side bathecl by the sun. Only there will you find pure
air, continually renewed by the winds and the friendly
zephyrs.

Especially guard yourself against laziness and non—
chalance. Go, go drive in their dens the bear and the
boar; hunt the deer from the crests of mountains to the
foot of the valleys and into the depths of the woodS.
