are first left in water to digest for the length of one day
and one night, then it is subjected to the action of fire.
Care is taken to manage the cooking ol the mixture with
economy, in such manner as to avoid a hard ebullition

liquid is evaporated in this manner until reduced to one-

then again taken up with water, shaken up with honey
and again cooked with a care that is entirely similar.
