As a fact, l have often seen the disease clear up by the
sweating and cure after long runs in the forests. This
is not all. Without false shame, take in hand the
plough and turn its share in the bosom of the earth;
armed with a hoe tear up the underbrush, strike with an
axe the towering oak, uproot the sycamore. Even at
home or in the evening, do not remain inactive. May
danning, shuttle-cock and palestra be then for you useful
and salutary exercises. No truce for the disease!
And, ii such labors cause you to often bitterly regret
the charms of a sweet repose and the delights of a solt
ancl downy couch, resist, resist with courage! Sleep
and repose are your enemies3 under the appearance of
a deceptive ease, they would do naught but feed and
render worse the disease in your bosom.

Drive away far from you the anxieties, pre-occupa-
uotis, and regrets3 far from you the trouble of passions
and the assiduity of serious studies! What suits your
state is the mild business of the muses, it is joyous
conpletas, and frolicsorne dances. At all events do not
succumb to the attractions of love; nothing could be
more harmful, and your kisses would taint the tender
daughters of Venus with a detestable contagion. Noth-
ing is more important for you than the ordering of your·
diet and the choice of foods Upon this point redouble
your attention and vigilance. In the first place banish
from the table all fish, no matter which they are, fish
from rivers or ponds, from fresh or from salt water. At
most you may, in case of necessity, indulge in those that
are fished near bluffs or falls and whose meat is white,
