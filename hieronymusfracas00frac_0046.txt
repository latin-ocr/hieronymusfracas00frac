Under the ardent fires of Cancer, in the bosom of an
immense sea in which the chariot of Phebus plunges at
the close of day, an island extends, narrow and long,
which the Spanish navigators were the first to land upon
and in remembrance of their country they called l-lis-
paniola. This land is sown with gold; but that which ’
makes a greater wealth for it than gold, is the precious
tree to which natives ol the country have given the name
of Guaiac.

Guaiac has a stem that is slender and cylindrical.
lts branches which are broadly spread are loaded with
a thick foliage that is always green, its fruit consists ol
small, numerous berries, which are astringent to the taste.

lts wood has the hardness of iron: under heat it ex-
udes a sticky resim when cut it is agreeably shaded in
colon green and shining like laurel just below the bark,
it takes on a little deeper the pale gray color of box, and
becomes darker up to black near its central portions, in
such lashion as to recall the tints of both ebony and of
walnut. Suppose that to these different colors red is
added, the scarf of Iris would not be more richly streaked.

The natives devote an extreme amount of care to the
culture of this tree. They force themselves to multiply
it; they cover their highlands and lowlands with it. They
cherish it, and they worship it as the equal of a saving
god. And it is not without reason, for it alone furnishes
a remedy against the implacable scourge which the heaven-
ly ire permanently maintains among them.

This remedy is thus prepared by them: Α stout'
branch is detached from the tree, it is freed ol its bark,
