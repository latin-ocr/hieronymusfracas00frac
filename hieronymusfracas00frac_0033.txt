soft and delicate; such are, for example, the phycine,
the demde, the gudgeon, the perch, friend of rocky
shores, and the scare, sole ruminant of the waves, the
constant guest of the mouths of rivers. Also abstain
from aquatic birds which, living along the banks of rivers
or in swamps. feed on nothing but fish. ln the same
manner avoid duck with its flesh charged with fat,
goose, which long ago saved the Capital‚ the full quail,
the bacon and entrails of the hog, the loin of boars
which have fallen under your blows in your murderous
hunts, cold cucumber, provocative tmffles, artichokes,
onions with the acrid and piquant taste, vinegar and
milk.

Do not let yourself be tempted either by the spark-
ling or frothy wines of the shores of Corsica, of Faler-
num or of Puini, or those which are produced in our
small forms by the grape of Rhetia. Nothing will be less
healthful for you than the light wines of the Sabine or
those of which the Naiads will have dulled the generous
odors. On the other hand, that of which you may freely
use, is comprised in all simple foods which are healthtul
and of which Nature is genereus in gardens, and which
are the delight to the gods; mint, cress, chicory, hare's
lettuce whose flower braves hoar trost, skirret‚ the friend
of small streams, sweet marlum, calamus with perfumed
odor, the coquettish melissa, ox-tongue which thrives best
on the edges of fountains‚ packet, spinage, sorrel‚ sam-
phire with salty buds‚ hops which interlaces with brush‚
byronia of which 1 advise you to gather the young before
the adult branch has spoilt the shoots and spread its seeds
