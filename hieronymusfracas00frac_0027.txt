which witnessed the flowing Italian blood mingled with
the French? Shall Ι tell ol those days of carnage
when the reddened waves ol the Tar poured into the
Eridan so many spoils ol war, so many dead bodies of
men and of hair piled about in confusion? Even thou,
nymph of Abdua, did not fail to see thy bosom soiled
by the blood of ours, ancl the Eridan could not allay
thy pain except by mingling its tears with thine, by
uniting its waves with thy desolate billows! And thus,
unfortunate Ausonia, thus it is that discord has ruined
thy power and has robbed thee ot the sceptre of the
world, the heritage of thy ancestors. Does there remain
in the whole extent of thy empire, does there remain a
single shred of ground which has not suffered the out-
rages ol conquest, the insult of the conqueror and the
horror of carnage? Answer, ye, banks which the
Erethene fecundates before precipitating itself in the
Adriatic, mingling its waves with those of the river of
the Euganean5‚ answer calm vineyardS, who until then
had never known the click of arms or the brawl ol
combats!

O my latherland, sacred soil, cradle of the gods,
Italy, mother of so many heroes, opulent country which
the Adigus and the Benacus fecundate, thou whom the
entire world envied formerly for its peacelul prosperity,
who today would be able to recite thy own fortunes, to
enumerate thy disasters, thy outrages‚ thy sufferings?
Ah, lower thy head, bend thy humiliated face. Bena-
cus, go, thy waves no longer bathe the land of laurels!
And, as if so much misfortune‚ and so many troubles
