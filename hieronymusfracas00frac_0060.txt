their pardon and their salety the torest made bloody by
their arms. Without more hesitation, they offered a
sacrifice to the Sun and to the Nymphs of that country.
Then they went to pluck in the forest branches of the
sacred wood, and prepared, according to the native rite,
the salutary brew which is to purify them. Thinking of
the distress of their companiom, they load their ships
with similar branches, in the hope that this precious
remedy will preserve its qualities under a foreign sky.
They finally leave. Propitious winds fill their sails;
Apollo himself directs their course.

Divine guaiae, it was Spain that had the happiness
oi first receiving on our continent and of being the first
to know thy marvelous virtues. Later the Gauls and
the Germans, Scythia and Latium implored thy help.
Salutations to thee, savior tree with the luxuriant trunk,
with the generous sap! We salute thee, the pride of the

New World! Ah! what would have been thy glory, if

propitious Destinies had caused thee to be born in this
land, the natal place of poets and of the gods! Α
stranger among us, mayest thou at least owe some part
ol thy honors to these verses as honors which are thy
due! Without doubt my Muse does not dare to aspire
to spread the noise of thy marvels from the confines of
Bactria to the ice-bergs of the pole or to the burning
sands of Ethiopia; but she will at least publish thy sub-
lime virtues among the peoples of Latium, in the fields
ol the Adigos and on the flowery banks of the Benacus;
perhaps even it will carry thy name to the ears ot Baubo,

on the banks of the Tiber, and this will be for her the

dearest reward for her labors.
