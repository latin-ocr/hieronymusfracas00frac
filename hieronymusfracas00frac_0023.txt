One of the most surprising of facts is that, after hav-
ing contracted the germ o't' the contagion‚ the victim at-
tacked by the scourge does not often present any lesion
that is well marked before the moon has four times ac-
complished· its travels. The disease, in fact, does not
show itself at once by accusing symptoms directly that it
has penetrated the organism. For a certain time it
broods in silence. as if it were gathering its forces for a
more terrible explosion. During this period, at all events,
a strange languor seizes the patient and depresses his
whole being3 his mind seems heavy, his limbs are soft,
and weakening, fail for work; the eye loses its flash and
the face is depressed in its expression and has become pale.

It is on the organs of generation that the virus first is
transported, to irradiate from there to the neighboring
parts and on the regions of the groin.

Soon after, more well defined symptoms show thern-
selves. When the light of day disappears to give place
to the shades of night, at the time when the inner heat
of living bodies leaves the peripheral parts to concentrate
upon the viscera, atrocious pains suddenly burst forth in
the limbs charged with vitiated humors and torture the
articulations, the arms, the shoulders, the calves. lt is
because at that moment. vigilant Nature, an enemy ol all
impurity, is at work to react against the putrid ferments
which the disease has introduced into the veins and with
which it has penetrated all the humors, all the nourishing
juices of the organisms. She strains to drive them away;
she energetically fights against them. But they resist3
thick, viscid, not displacing themselves except slowly,
