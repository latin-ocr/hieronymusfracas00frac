All beings with which Nature has peopled land, air
and the water, have not one mode of creation‚ which is
identical and subject to the same laws. The most sirn-
ple‚ whose formation calls but for a lew generating prin-
ciples, are incessantly reproduced everywhere. Others,
more complex, require for their being the help of many
germs which are dispersed, succeeding but very rarely and
with difficulty in being born at certain times and in cer-
tain places. Others, finally, corne out ol nothingness but
alter thousands ol centuries, so many are the obstacles
presented to the germs which are necessary to their
genesis ancl to their union. WelL the same is true of
diseases. All diseases do not have a common or iden-
tical origin. The ones, the majority even, have an easy
development which accounts for their habitual frequency3
but, others are ol a difficult sort to deliver and succeed
but very slowly to constitute themselves, after having
long fought against the infinite difficulties which destiny
opposed to their birth. Of this number, for instance, is
elephantiasis, still unknown by Ausonia, and lichen which
remains confined on the banks of the Nile. Of this num-
