air pours its poisons only on vegetation, killing the flowers
and the tender buds, tainting the wheat with an unclean
rust, destroying all hopes ol crops, changing seeds as
deep as the very bosom of earth. At other times it is
the animals only that are struck, and that, either all at

in a year that was remarkable not only for an unusual
and suspicious fertility of the soil, but also by an exces-
sive frequency of Southern winds and ol autumnal rains,
that all goats—and only goats—were affected by disease.
They came out of the sheds full of vigor and health;
then, at the same moment that they were cheerfully
browsing the grass of the meadows, they were attacked
with a suffocating cough‚ a certain prelude of death.
They were then seen to turn convulsively on themselves
and fall exhausted, among their companions, and soon
give up their last breath. Then, a surprising thing3 in
the spring and in the summer which followed, it became
the turn of the various cattle, whom a malignant lever
decimated to the point of almost completely destroying
thern. As a matter ol fact, celestial influences are varied
in an infinite degree like the events derived from them,
andro each one ol them is intimately bound a certain
order of phenomena.

And on the other hand, what diversity in the morbid
germs, what oddity in their effects! You shall judge of
them.

The miasms contained in the atmosphere are found
in direct contact with the eyes; well, it is not only the
