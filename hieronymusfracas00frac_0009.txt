THIS CELEBRATED POEM OF
HIERONYMUS FRA CASTOR

has endured through nearly four
centuries. To the author is due the
credit os having given this name
which, not only supplanted the many
others which had been given to it,
but which has perszstea’ to the pres-
ent day ana' is in universal use.
Whilst this poem is filled with
mythological allusions it affords a
good clinical description os the
symptoms os the disease. lt shows,
throughout its lines, the erudition
of its author, his keeh appreciation
os the important-e of the subject as
well as his mastery os the matter in
hand. It may be suggested that to
treat such a subject in Latin hex-
ameters is not very set ious but we
will call the attention of those crit-
ics that the poem is merely a pulling·
in verse, by the author, of his small
prose treatsse, De Contagiom‘bus et
Contagiosis Morbis, publishea' in
1546. Born in 1483, Fracastor was
still a child when the fllorbus Galli-
cus made its first appearance in
Europe. Howeven he did not attrib-
ute the disease to the invasion os
Charles VIII.‚ but regarded it as
much more ancient.
