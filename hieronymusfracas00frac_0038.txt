molecules, apt to infiltrate themselves in the warp ol tis-
sues, have the power of pursuing and consuming even to
the bxttom of organs the impure yeasts of the disease;
or finally that its magic virtues are derived from some
occult force whose mystery escapes us. But, I stop, for
before all [must here state how that remedy was re-
vealed to man by a divine hand, and celebrate in my
verses this good deed of the gods.

ln a valley of Syria, shaded by the luxuriant foliage
ol willows and cut by the murmuring waves ol Callirhoe,
there formerly lived, it is said, a husbandman named
llceus. He divided his tranquil lite between the labors
of his field, and the cultivation of a garden consecrated to

the gods of the field in which grew through his care gallin-
gate‚ the cassia trec, and perfumecl ginger. Suddenly‚
O horrors, he was struck by the terrible scourge. The
unfortunate man, in his distress‚ called the heavens to his
aid: “Ye gods that l adore,” he cried, “have pity on my
torture! And thou, beneficent Callirhoe, thou who al-
ways curest our ills, do not forget that but a few days
since l made an offering to thee, on the trunk of an oak,
of the carcass of the deer that had fallen under my blows.
Powerful divinities, if your clemency delivers me from
this awful disease which tortures me night and day, my
grateful hand will not cease to load your altars with
crowns and flowers. F rom this time on my most pleas-
ing violets and my whitest lilies go to you: to you the
buddrng roses and the first hyacinths of my humble place.''
l-le spoke and tell back exhausted on the grass.
