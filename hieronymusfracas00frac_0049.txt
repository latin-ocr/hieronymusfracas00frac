waves, twice hast thou turned thy silvery crescent to us,
twice hast thou filled thy course, and nothing yet offers
itself to us but the immensity of the waves. Land flees
before us. For our grace, cause some shore to appear
at the horizon, and directus, O, goddess, to those worlds
that we seek for so long Γ

Diana heard the prayer; she at once came down
from the sky, botrows the features of the Nereids
Cynothos and Clotho, then, mingling with the group of
nymphs that surrounded the fleet‚ she answered the hero
in these words: “Courage, beloved son, contage ! The
days that will shine shall not be done without land ap-
pearing before thine eyes, without a port to shelter thy
vessels. But do not stop at the first shore that thou shalt
meet. lt is further on that the Destinies call thee. Be-
yond that these seas bold a large island of the name off
Ophiu there, only must thou lirnit thy course and found
the capital of thy empire ‘s'

She had spoken, and touched the ship with her hand,
which, pushed by favoring winds‚ lightly passed over the

azure off the waves.

The chariot of Phebus had scarcely emerged from
the waves when a foggy point appeared at the horizon;
it is land! Soon, as a ffact, the squadron came in view
of a shore, off the shore so long desired. lt lands‚ it salutes
this hospitable soil, and returns to heaven a just tribute
of actions and of thanks. Then the crew seeks in repose
new strength for the ffatigues that are to come.
