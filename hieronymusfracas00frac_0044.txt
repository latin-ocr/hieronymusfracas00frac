patients, a truce to the disgust which may be caused
by this remedy! F or if itis disgusting, the disease is
still more so. Beside5‚ your cure is at this price. So,
without hesitation, spread this mixture on your body
and cover with it your entire skin, with the exception of
the head and of the precordial region. Then, carefully
wrap yourself in wool and tow; then get into bed, load
yourself with bed covering and thus await until a sweat
bathes your limbs with an impure dew. Ten days in
succession renew this treatment, for ten entire days you
are to undergo this cruel trial whose beneficiat effect will
not cause you to wait.

As a matter of fact, very soon an inlallible presage
will announce to you the hour off your freedom. Very
soon you will feel the ferments ol the disease dissolve
themselves in your mouth in a disgusting flow of saliva,
and you will see the virus, even the virus, evacuate itsell
at your feet in rivers of saliva.

ll, during the course of this treatment, small ulcers
develop in your mouth, have a care to fight thern with
gargles of milk or by a decoction of pomegranate privet.
This treatment being completed‚ you may then, without
leat, recall Bacchus to your table and enjoy in full liberty
the generous nectars ol Pharia, off Falernum and ol Chios.

The disease thus subdued, a last and very simple
matter remains lor you to carry out in order to complete
your victorious work. lt is that of purifying your body
of the last taints by means of ablutions, for which laven-
der‚ marjararn, rosemary‚ verbena and clary offer you
their perfumed odors.
