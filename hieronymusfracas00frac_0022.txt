eyes that they affect, it is the lung that they will reach
in the depths of the chest! ln the same manner also
we occasionally see the tendet grape preserve itself intact
next to hardier fruits which die away; and when, in its
turn, it dies, either by impoverishment of the seed, or by
a swelling or a shrinking of its pores, itis never so except
under the influence of causes that are proper to it.

Let us now study the symptoms ol this scourge which
a celestial influx has caused and reproduced after centu-
ries that it was forgotton. This disease does not affect
the dumb inhabitants of the wave‚ nor the wild beasts ol
the forests, nor the birds of the sky, nor horses nor cattle.
lt only has to do with man3 man alone is its prey.

ln the human body, it is the blood that it attacks at
first, and, feeding on naught but fat and viscid humors‚
it is on the fat and corrupted parts of this fluid that it
preferably attaches itself.

Here especially, O muse, l claim thy help to limn
the picture ol this execrable pestilence. Deign also to
inspire me, Apollo, god ol the day, god of poetry‚ and
make matters such that my work may, thanks to thee,
remain through coming centuries. Α day, in fact, may
perhaps come when our great grand nephews will take
the pleasure ol consulting the description of a forgotten
disease. Forgotten, yes, for no one doubts at a given
time this disease will return into the clouds of nothing-
ness. And no one doubts also but that, after another
series of centuries, it will return to the light, to afflict
anew the world and once more spread terror among the
peoples of another age.
