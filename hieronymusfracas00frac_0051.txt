ing wicks fire the powder, a murderous mixture of sulphur,
of nitre and of willow charcoah the lightning flashes, the
shot occurs, the balls whistle in the air, and the ground
is covered with dead bodies! The sky at the same
moment is lighted up by thousands of fires, lightnings plow
the clouds and shakes‚ by its angry claps, the shore, the
forest and even down to the deep caves of the sea.
Terrified, those of the birds who have escaped the car-
nage take refuge upon the heights of the rocks, or ask ior
refuge from the darkest caves. But one of them, O
prodigy, stops upon a pointed peak and offers these
sinister prophecies: “Cursed strangers‚ your sacreligious
hand has struck the birds of the Sun. Woe be unto
you! Learn from me the punishment with which Apollo
will visit your crime. ll favorable winds have brought
you to the banks oi Ophir, which you sought for such a
long time, it is only at the price of thousands of disasters
and of thousands of diseases that it will be given to you
to reach this other world from which you hope to steal
its ancient liberty. All the scourges of the earth and of
the waves will be let loose upon your heads. War will
decimare you; these waves will enguli your squadrons;
this shore will be covered with your remains, and very
few among you will see the sky off your native land!
Europe will reluse you all help, ancl whilst Discord will
turn against you your own armS, this land will bring {orth
giants to crush you. ln fine, an unknown pestilence will
spread upon you its noisome‚ tainted marks, until the day
when, suppliants, you will corne here and implore pardon
